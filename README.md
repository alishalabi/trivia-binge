Endless trivia game using Jeopardy's API. Website built in HTML/CSS/JS and Node/Express

***
Note on files for reviewer:
The original barebones of the website will originally be written in HTML/CSS/JS, and will use the files:
- basic.html
- basic-css.html
- basic-scripts.js (coming soon)
Depending on how many features are added, these files will them be migrated over to a Node.js project to crud resources (ex: User profiles)


This website will use Jeopardy's API to stream a (seemingly) limitless supply of trivia questions. 

Users will be able to view questions by either searching for a category, or from a random category. 

In a future version, Wikipedia's API will be integrated to provide informational widgets about each answer. Ex: If the answer to a question is "William Shakespear," a widget about William Shakespear will be presented.

v0: HTML/CSS barebones of homepage
v1: Integrate Jeopardy API to generate dictionary of questions/answers
v2: Clean-looking UI built off of custom CSS
v3: Integrate Wikipedia API to generate information widgets
